HackIllinois API
================
This repository contains the code which runs the backend supporting HackIllinois. The codebase is currently being transitioned from a multi-repository version control system to a mono-repository version control system. As a result there way be build errors until this transition is complete. More information about building, contributing, and running the API will be available soon.
